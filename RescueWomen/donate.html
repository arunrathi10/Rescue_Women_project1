            <p>
                When I first reached out to Rescue Women, I was scared and had nowhere to turn.
                I had endured years of abuse and felt completely trapped. Thanks to the generosity
                of donors, I was able to find shelter, receive counseling, and gain legal support.
                They helped me rebuild my life and gave me the strength to stand on my own again.
                Today, I am safe, confident, and starting a new chapter with my children.
                I couldnâ€™t have done it without the support from people like you.
